<h1>Welcome to "Story"</h1>
<p>Toby Fox got the idea of creating Undertale many years before of its release. <br> When Toby was a kid, he loved playing Earthbound, a series of RPG games originated in Japan. These games did not receive much attention in America, and Toy had no one to talk with about his favorite RPG. <br>

  <br>

  <br> When Toby got 13, he joined an online community all about Earthbound. He finally had someone that could enjoy the same things as he did. Toby started creating their own fan hacks of the game, messing around with the software "RPGmaker". He started to submit his fan hacks to various online contests. His hacks were moderately successful, and Toby was pleased with his works. <br> <br>Game design wasn't Toby's only hobby, he also loved playing an instrument and creating music. With these two talents, Toby found his first, part-time job. He was hired by Andrew Hussie, creator of the popular webcomic/game/animation, "Homestuck". Tobby created tracks for the comic, while Andrew created the actual comic. <br>

  <br> While working on the music for the Homestuck series, Toby also strated experimenting creating his original, roleplaying game. In this period of time, Toby Fox's love for Japan increased. He started to play other Japanese games, such as Shin Megami Tensei, that allowed the player to talk with monsters that they faced. Toby wanted to expand this concept, and he began adding a battle mechanic that could allow the player to slay the monsters, but also talk and spare them, creating a unique mechanic. The option of slaying the monsters remained, but this would have changed the stryline of the game and presented more challenges to the player. Slowly, Toby's game started taking shape. After designing the mechanics, he started creating fun characters to fill up the story. He started thinking about how the player could have solved situations, and how the game would've responded.<br> <br> And so, The demo of the game was made. Toby shared it with his friends, even with the ones met online in the earthbound community. Everyone loved it, and Toby thought, that with a little more resources, he could make something fun that a few people might get a kick out of. <br> <br>Toby started a kickstarter online, asking for five thousand dollars to complete his game. The game's founding exploded, and by the end of the donations, he had received over fifty thousand dollars. Toby was a little anxious. He originally thought about a small, little game for the Earthbound core fans, not something that so many people would appreciate. He started working hours and hours, only thinking about how many people would have disappointed when the game was finally released. He even hired an assistant, Tuyoki Chang, that helped him finish the final designs of the characters. When the game was finished, Toby posted it online, scared of what people might have thought of. The people were satisfied, they loved the final game. He started getting a lot of attention. He thought about stopping there, but another game, was yet to come. Deltarune.</p>
